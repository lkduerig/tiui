Layout rules
===================================

https://smacss.com/book/type-layout

Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules
together.

Here you can use ids for major selectors that usually occur only once, such as
#header, #footer and #article.
Use classnames for minor selectors that are repeated, such as .region or .span.
