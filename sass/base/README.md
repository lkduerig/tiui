Base rules
===================================

https://smacss.com/book/type-base

Base rules are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element
selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors,
child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that
wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
No classes or ids in this directory!

Examples of Base Styles:

html, body, form { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
input[type=text] { border: 1px solid #999; }
a { color: #039; }
a:hover { color: #03C; }
